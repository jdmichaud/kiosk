The `resource.qrc` file is used to package the 
[resources files](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/resources.html) (images, qml files,
other data) into the executable itself. Those resources can them be queried
using the qrc url scheme (e.g. `qrc:/path/to/resource`). The path being
relative to the `resource.qrc` file itself.
